# 🚀 Machine Learning Project Series

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision projects** developed by me as part of continuous learning and hands-on practice.

Each project in this series focuses on **real-world datasets**, **practical implementation**, and **end-to-end workflows**, including data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
